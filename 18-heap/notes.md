# Heap

Heap is a binary search tree that has its numbers distributed in a different way where the highest value will always be at the top if its a `max heap` or lowest value at the top if its a `min heap`.

This means that heaps are not great for searching, but it's great for keeping track of the highest value at the top and remove it
